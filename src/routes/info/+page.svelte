    What is this project about?
    <br />
    <br /> The Garden app seeks to invert the typical narrative of digital
    technology as a force of isolation and detachment. Instead of pulling us
    deeper into the virtual world, Lusthof leverages technology to foster
    real-world connections and appreciation for the natural world. This approach
    envisions technology not as an isolating force, but as a catalyst for
    tangible, meaningful interactions.
    <br /><br />In The Garden, each user begins with a single seed, representing
    the potential for growth and connection. To enrich the communal garden and
    diversify their seed collection, users must engage with other gardeners. The
    combination of the Large Language Model (LLM) Chat-GPT and the text-to-image
    model DALL-E synthesises the characteristics of two plants to create a new,
    unique seedling.
    <br /><br />
    Initially, the app reflects classical garden aesthetics, where individual spaces
    are distinctly separated. These early stages of the garden echo historical views
    of gardens as paradisesâ€”exclusive, controlled environments that showcase human
    mastery over nature. However, as more plants are added, the garden evolves into
    a more chaotic, uncontrolled space. This transformation prompts critical reflection
    on the extent of control we exert through technology and within the garden itself.
    It challenges us to reconsider whether such control is desirable or necessary.
    <br /><br />Blending Digital and Natural Worlds <br /><br />The evolution
    from order to chaos mirrors broader questions about technology's role. By
    blending digital innovation with real-world interactions, Lusthof invites
    users to consider the balance between technological control and the vitality
    of the natural world.
